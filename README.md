Clerk takes a Clojure namespace and turns it into a notebook:

## üé™ [Demos](http://nextjournal.github.io/clerk-demo/)

Clerk comes with a [demo repo](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk-demo/) full of interesting use cases. Check them out and feel free to add your own via PRs.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Rationale

Computational notebooks allow arguing from evidence by mixing prose with executable code. For a good overview of problems users encounter in traditional notebooks like Jupyter, see [I don't like notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U) and [What‚Äôs Wrong with Computational Notebooks? Pain Points, Needs, and Design Opportunities](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/\~azh/pubs/Chattopadhyay2020CHI_NotebookPainpoints.pdf).

Specifically Clerk wants to address the following problems:

* Less helpful than my editor
* Notebook code being hard to reuse
* Reproduction problems coming from out-of-order execution
* Problems with archival and putting notebooks in source control

Clerk is a notebook library for Clojure that aims to address these problems by doing less, namely:

* no editing environment, folks can keep using the editors they know and love
* no new format: Clerk notebooks are regular Clojure namespaces (interspersed with markdown comments). This also means Clerk notebooks are meant to be stored in source control.
* no out-of-order execution: Clerk notebooks always evaluate from top to bottom. Clerk builds a dependency graph of Clojure vars and only recomputes the needed changes to keep the feedback loop fast.
* no external process: Clerk runs inside your Clojure process, giving Clerk access to all code on the classpath.

## üö¶ Status
ALPHA, expect breaking changes.

## üë©‚Äçüé® Using Clerk

To use Clerk in your project, add the following dependency to your `deps.edn`:

```edn
{:deps {io.github.nextjournal/clerk {:mvn/version "0.5.346"}}}
```

Require and start Clerk as part of your system start, e.g. in `user.clj`:

```clojure
(require '[nextjournal.clerk :as clerk])

;; start Clerk's buit-in webserver on the default port 7777, opening the browser when done
(clerk/serve! {:browse? true})

;; either call `clerk/show!` explicitly
(clerk/show! "notebooks/rule_30.clj")

;; or let Clerk watch the given `:paths` for changes
(clerk/serve! {:watch-paths ["notebooks" "src"]})

;; start with watcher and show filter function to enable notebook pinning
(clerk/serve! {:watch-paths ["notebooks" "src"] :show-filter-fn #(clojure.string/starts-with? % "notebooks")})

```

You can then access Clerk at <http://localhost:7777>.

See the [/notebooks folder](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/tree/main/notebooks) in the Clerk repository for a number of sample notebooks.

### Editor Workflow

For even better flow states, we recommend you bind `clerk/show!` to a shortcut in your favorite editor:

#### Emacs

In Emacs, add the following to your config:

```elisp
(defun clerk-show ()
  (interactive)
  (save-buffer)
  (let
      ((filename
        (buffer-file-name)))
    (when filename
      (cider-interactive-eval
       (concat "(nextjournal.clerk/show! \"" filename "\")")))))

(define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "<M-return>") 'clerk-show)
```

#### IntelliJ/Cursive

In IntelliJ/Cursive, you can [set up REPL commands](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/repl.html#repl-commands) via:

* going to `Tools‚ÜíREPL‚ÜíAdd New REPL Command`, then
* add the following command: `(show! "~file-path")`;
* make sure the command is executed in the `nextjournal.clerk` namespace;
* lastly assign a shortcut of your choice via `Settings‚ÜíKeymap`

#### Neovim + Conjure

With [neovim](https://neovim.io/) + [conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure/) one can use the following vimscript function to save the file and show it with Clerk:

```
function! ClerkShow()
  exe "w"
  exe "ConjureEval (nextjournal.clerk/show! \"" . expand("%:p") . "\")"
endfunction

nmap <silent> <localleader>cs :execute ClerkShow()<CR>
```

## ü™ö Developing Clerk
Make sure you have [Babashka installed](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation), and run:

```bash
bb dev
```

The will start everything needed to develop Clerk. You can connect your favorite editor to it using nREPL.
