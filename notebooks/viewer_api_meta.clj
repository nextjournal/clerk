;; Clerk's viewer api has been based on functions like in the following example.

(def tabular-data
  (clerk/table {:col-1 ["a" "b" "c"] :col-2 ["a" "b" "c"]}))

;; This isn't always what you want as it performs a transformation of your data.
(keys tabular-data)

;; You can alternatively use metadata on the form to convey the viewer.
^{::clerk/viewer clerk/table}
(def tabular-data-untouched
  {:col-1 ["a" "b" "c"] :col-2 ["a" "b" "c"]})

;; And see that it remains untouched. This comes with the added benefit that changing a viewer does not require a recomputation.
(keys tabular-data-untouched)

;; This also works on literals, not just on vars. Though you will less care about transformation in that case â€“ as you'll not be holding a reference to it. As you see in the following example, you can also use keywords instead of functions. This is useful when you don't want to require Clerk.
