;; Clerk will now treat `clojure.core/deref` expresssions seperately in the dependency graph and attempt to compute a hash at runtime based on the value of the expression. This lets Clerk see an updated value for these expressions without needing to opt out of Clerk's caching.

(map inc @!state)

;; In addition, folks can now specify a `::clerk/hash-fn` that makes the hashing user-extensible. Here, we use it to know when a file has changed.

;; ### TODO
;; * [x] clean up `find-location`
;; * [x] fix deref'ing vars, e.g. `@(var contents)`
;; * [x] Uncomment & fix `no-cache?` tests
;; * [x] Restore & fix _"defcached should be treated like a normal def"_
;; * [x] Fix deps graph for vars
