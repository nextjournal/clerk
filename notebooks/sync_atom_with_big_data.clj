;; # Clerk synced atoms and large data

;; **1.** Define a Clerk synced atom called `!state`.

^::clerk/sync
(def !state
  (atom []))

@!state

;; **2.** Verify that `!state` is present on both sides.

^::clerk/no-cache
(clerk/eval-cljs '!state)

;; **3.** Make a button to cram a lot of data into `!state` on the SCI side.
