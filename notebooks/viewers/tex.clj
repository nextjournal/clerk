;; The Einstein-Field Equations are:
(clerk/tex "G_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu} - {\\textstyle 1 \\over 2}R\\,g_{\\mu\\nu} = {8 \\pi G \\over c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}")

;; Formulas should render correctly both inline $e^{2\pi i}-1 = 0$ as well as in blocks
;;
;; $${\frac{d}{d t} \frac{âˆ‚ L}{âˆ‚ \dot{q}}}-\frac{âˆ‚ L}{âˆ‚ q}=0.$$
;;
;; also called _display mode_ in $\LaTeX$. The same should render fine in markdown results:

(clerk/md "Inline $e^{2\\pi i}-1 = 0$ and block

$${\\frac{d}{d t} \\frac{âˆ‚ L}{âˆ‚ \\dot{q}}}-\\frac{âˆ‚ L}{âˆ‚ q}=0.$$")
