;; ## Soft vs. Hard Line Breaks
;; This one ⇥
;; ⇤ is a [soft break](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#soft-line-breaks) and is rendered as a space.
;;
;; This one instead ⇥\
;; ⇤ is a [hard break](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#hard-line-breaks) and is rendered as a newline.

;; ## Sidenotes
;;
;; One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his _extensive use
;; of sidenotes_[^sidenote]. Sidenotes are like footnotes,
;; except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the
;; page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have
;; noticed their use in this document already^[If you are _astute_ enough!]. You are very astute.
;;
;; [^sidenote]: This is a sidenote. The purpose of this text is to
;; merely demonstrate the use of sidenotes. All text was originally published
;; on the [Tufte CSS website](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
;;
;; Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently
;; large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and
;; small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are
;; hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related
;; but not necessary information such as asides or citations as close as possible
;; to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information
;; should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of
;; ideas in the main text.
;;
;; We also have to consider however that sidenotes can be part of a blockquote,
;; like so:
;; > “The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers.” [^hamming]
;; >
;; > ― Richard Hamming
;;
;; [^hamming]: From _"The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn"_
;; by Richard Hamming
;;
;; And it can be followed by lists so the list layout also has to adapt to the
;; new content width once a sidenote is present in the document:
;;
;; Things to do:

;; * Hire two private investigators. Get them to follow each other.
;; * Wear t-shirt that says "Life". Hand out lemons^[not oranges] on street corner.
;;   * Wear t-shirt that says "Life". Hand out lemons^[not oranges] on street corner.
;; * Change name to Simon. Speak in thirs person.
;; * Major in philosophy. Ask people WHY they would like fries with that.
