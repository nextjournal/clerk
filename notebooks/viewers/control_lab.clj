;; Let's go through the ways we can use this.

;; 1️⃣ On a var coming from a def
^{::clerk/sync true ::clerk/viewer (make-slider {})}
(defonce !num (atom 0))

;; 2️⃣ On a sharp quoted symbol (works with a fully qualified one as well, ofc).
(clerk/with-viewer (make-slider)
  `!num)

;; 3️⃣ On a var
^{::clerk/viewer (make-slider)}
#'!num

;; 4️⃣ On an explicit `ViewerEval` type
(clerk/with-viewer (make-slider)
  (viewer/->viewer-eval `!num))


#_#_ ;; TODO: plain (not quoted) symbol
^{::clerk/viewer (make-slider {})}
!num
;; TODO: reactivity with default viewer
(viewer/->viewer-eval `!num)

;; We can customise the slider by passing different opts (that are merged).

(clerk/with-viewer (make-slider {:max 200})
  `!num)

;; Or use a completely custom `:render-fn`.
(clerk/with-viewer (assoc viewer-eval-viewer :render-fn '(fn [x] [:h2.bg-green-500.rounded-xl.text-center @x]))
  `!num)

@!num
