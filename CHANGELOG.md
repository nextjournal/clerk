* 💫 Add experimental `defcached` and `with-cache` macros to enable access to Clerk's view of a var or expression respectively.
* 💫 Let code viewers use horizontal scrolling instead of line  wrapping to improve readability, especially on mobile.

* 💫 Upgrade to SCI v0.3.1

## 0.5.346 (2022-01-27)
This release focuses on improving the viewer api:

* 🌟 new built-in image viewer component  for `java.awt.image.BufferedImage` with automatic layouting. These can be easily created constructed from `java.imageio.ImageIO/read` from `File`, `URL` or `InputStream`.
* 🌟 Enable nested viewers inside e.g. `html` or `table` viewers.
* 🌟 Allow to convey viewers out-of-band using metadata. Clerk's viewer api has been based on functions. This can be undesired if you want to depend on the unmodified value downstream. You can now alternatively use metadata using the `:nextjournal.clerk/viewer` to convey the viewer. Valid values are viewer functions or keywords. The latter is useful when you don't want a runtime dependency on Clerk. (#58)
* 💫 `:render-fn` must now be quoted to make it clearer it doesn't run on the JVM but in the browser (#53)
* 💫 Make all viewer functions take an optional map to specify the with using the `:nextjournal.clerk/width` with valid values `:full`, `:wide` or `:prose`. (#53)
* 💫 Enable access to vars resulting from eval in viewers @philomates (#47)
* 💫 Expose title, table of contents as the result of parse. Set title in browser. @zampino (#56)
* 💫 Add halt! to allow stopping Clerk @SneakyPeet (#43)*
* 💫 Upgrade to tailwindcss 3 and use via play cdn. This enables using any tailwind properties. (#36)
* 💫 Allow to bring your own css and js (#55)
* 🐜 Introduce print budget to elide deeply nested structures. This should fix overflowing the browser with too much data for certain shapes of data (#48)
* 🐞 Recover from a viewer rendering error without requiring a browser reload and improve error display.
* 🛠 Refactor & tests various parts

## 0.4.316 (2021-12-21)
* 💫 Add option to control opening of built static app (@filipesilva, #31)
* 🐜 Fix path error on windows by bumping markdown dep (#34)
* 🐞 Fix browse in `build-static-app!` on windows (#39)

## 0.4.305 (2021-12-13)
* 🌟 Support markdown as an alternative to Clojure source code for prose-heavy documents.
* 🌟 Changed viewer api: Added a `:transform-fn` that allows a transformation of a value in JVM Clojure. Also rename `:fn` to `:render-fn` for clarify and ensure the `:pred` only runs on JVM Clojure to enable using predicates that cannot run in sci in the browser. Add support for serving arbitrary blobs  via a `:fetch-fn` that returns a map with `:nextjournal/content-type` and `nextjournal/value` keys ([example](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/blob/8ad88630f746f1a9ff3ac314f5528c2d25c42583/notebooks/viewers/image.clj)).
* 🌟 Added `v/clerk-eval` to the viewer api which takes a quoted form and evaluates it in the context of the document namespace.
* ⭐️ Allow setting code cell & result visibility via
  `:nextjournal.clerk/visibility` metadata on a form. Valid values are: `:show` (default) `:fold` or `:hide`. These settings can be set on individual forms, setting them on the `ns` form changes the default for all forms in the document. If you want to affect only the `ns` form, use  `:fold-ns` or `:hide-ns` ([example](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/blob/8ad88630f746f1a9ff3ac314f5528c2d25c42583/notebooks/visibility.clj)).
* 💫 Added a dynamic binding `config/*in-clerk*` that is only true when Clerk is driving evaluation.
* 💫 Persist viewer expansion state across document reloads and make document updates minimize repaints and flickering.
* 💫 Keep document scroll position when an error is shown by moving error into overlay.
* 💫 Wrap sci context in an atom to let consumers change it.
* 💫 Exclude Emacs lock files from being shown via file watcher #22 (@ikappaki)
* 💫 Add viewers for Clojure vars and a catch all `pr-str` viewer
* 🐜 Don't cache uncountable values within `*bounded-count-limit*` #15.
* 🐞 Prevent infinite loop when calling `show!` in a notebook using `config/*in-clerk*`.
