## 0.15.957 (2023-09-28)

* 🔌 Offline support

  Support working fully offline by adding a ServiceWorker to intercept and cache network requests to remote assets in the browser. It works for Clerk's js bundle, its tailwind css script, fonts and as well as javascript dynamically loaded using d3-require like Clerk's Vega and Plotly viewers.

  To use it, you need to open Clerk in the browser when online to populate the cache. Viewers that are dynamically loaded (e.g. Vega or Plotly) need to be used once while offline to be cached. We're considering loading them on worker init in a follow up.

* 👁️ Improve viewer customization

    * Simplify customization of number of rows displayed for table viewer using viewer-opts, e.g. `(clerk/table {::clerk/page-size 7})`. Pass `{::clerk/page-size nil}` to display elisions. Can also be passed a form metadata. Fixes [#406](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/406).

    * Change semantics of `clerk/add-viewers!` to perform in-place positional replacement of named added viewers. Anonymous viewers (without a `:name`) or new named viewers will be prepended to the viewer stack. Assign a symbol `:name` to all of `clerk/default-viewers`.

    * Support first-class `:add-viewers` attribute on viewer map which will do `clerk/add-viewers` before passing viewers down the tree. Use it in `table-viewer` and `markdown-viewer`. Both these viewers can now be customized more easily. For example, you can customize the `table-viewer` to show missing values differently, see [Book of Clerk](https://book.clerk.vision/#tables).

* 🚨 Rename `:nextjournal.clerk/opts` to `:nextjournal.clerk/render-opts` to clarify this options map is available as the second arg to parametrize the `:render-fn`. Still support the `:nextjournal.clerk/opts` for now.

* 🚨 Simplify html rendering internals
  
  Removed
  
    * `nextjournal.clerk.viewer/reagent-viewer`,
    * `nextjournal.clerk.render/html-viewer`,
    * `nextjournal.clerk.render/html`, and
    * `nextjournal.clerk.render/render-reagent`. 
    
  From now on, please use
  * `nextjournal.clerk.viewer/html-viewer`, and
  * `nextjournal.clerk.viewer/html` instead.
  
  Also rename `nextjournal.clerk.render/html-render` to `nextjournal.clerk.render/render-html` and make `nextjournal.clerk.viewer/html` use it when called from a reactive context.
  
* 🚨 Unify the link handling between `build!` and `serve!` 

  By no longer using extensions in either mode (was `.clj|md` in `serve!` and `.html` in `build!`).
  
  To support this in the unbundled static build, we're now writing directories with `index.html` for each notebook. This makes links in this build no longer accessible without a http server. If you're looking for a self-contained html that works without a webserver, set the `:bundle` option.

* 📖 Improve Table of Contents design and fixing re-rendering issues. Also added suport for chapter expansion.

* 📒 Mention Tap Inspector in Book of Clerk & on Homepage

* 🛠 Upgrade `framer-motion` dep to `10.12.16`.

* 💫 Assign `:name` to every viewer in `default-viewers`

* 🐜 Ensure `var->location` returns a string path location fixing `Cannot open <#object[sun.nio.fs.UnixPath ,,,> as an InputStream` errors

* 🐞 Don't run existing files through `fs/glob`, fixes [#504](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/504). Also improves performance of homepage.

* 🐞 Show correct non-var return value for deflike form, fixes [#499](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/499)

## 0.14.919 (2023-06-13)

* 🚨 Breaking Changes:

    * Change `nextjournal.clerk.render/clerk-eval` to not recompute the currently shown document when using the 1-arity version. Added a second arity that takes an opts map with a `:recompute?` key.

    * Change `nextjournal.clerk/eval-cljs` to only take one form (like `clojure.core/eval`) but support viewer opts. If you want multiple forms to be evaluated, wrap them in a `do`.


* 💈 Show execution progress

    To see what's going on while waiting for a long-running computation, Clerk will now show an execution status bar on the top. For named cells (defining a var) it will show the name of the var, for anonymous expressions, a preview of the form.

* 🔗 Interactive Links, Index and Homepage

    Links can now be followed in interactive mode and the index can be viewed. Previously this could only be seen after a `build!`. Add support evaluating a given doc by entering it in the browser's address bar.

    Use these features to build a new welcome page that gives more useful information, including links to potential notebooks in the project.

* ⚡️ Speed up analysis of gitlibs using git sha, resolve protocol methods

    This significantly speeds up analysis for gitlibs by using the git sha as a hash (thus treating them as immutable) instead of handling them on a per-form level.

    Also resolve protocol methods to the defining protocol, which would previously not be detected.

    Lastly drop the location cache which is no longer needed.

* 🍕 Add `clerk/fragment` for splicing a seq of values into the document as if it were produced by results of individual cells. Useful when programmatically generating content.

* 🚰 Improve Tap Inspector

    * Support customizing of `:nextjournal.clerk/width` and `:nextjournal.clerk/budget` for individual tapped values
    * Fix re-rendering of tapped values by assigning stable react keys
    * Build it on top of `clerk/fragment`

* 🍒 Add support for cherry as an alternative to sci to evaluate `:render-fn`s. You can change it per form (using form metadata or viewer opts) or doc-wide (using ns metadata) with `{:nextjournal.clerk/render-evaluator :cherry}`.

* 🏳️‍🌈 Syntax highlighting for code listings in all [languages supported by codemirror](https://github.com/codemirror/language-data) ([#500](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/500)).

* ⭐️ Adds support for customization of viewer options

  Support both globally (via ns metadata or a settings marker) or locally (via form metadata or the viewer options map).

  Supported options are:
   * `:nextjournal.clerk/auto-expand-results?`
   * `:nextjournal.clerk/budget`
   * `:nextjournal.clerk/css-class`
   * `:nextjournal.clerk/visibility`
   * `:nextjournal.clerk/width`
   * `:nextjournal.clerk/render-evaluator`

* 🔌 Make websocket reconnect automatically on close to avoid having to reload the page

* 💫 Cache expressions that return `nil` in memory

* 💫 Support non-evaluated clojure code listings in markdown documents by specifying `{:nextjournal.clerk/code-listing true}` after the language ([#482](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/482)).

* 💫 Support imported vars (e.g. by potemkin) in location analysis

    By considering `:file` on var meta in location analysis. Previously we would not find a location for vars where the namespace did not match the source file. As we're not caching negative findings this can speed up analysis for deps with a large number of imported vars significantly.
    
* 💫 Support serializing `#inst` and `#uuid` to render-fns

* 🐜 Turn off analyzer pass for validation of `:type` tags, fixes [#488](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/488) @craig-latacora

* 🐜 Strip `:type` metadata from forms before printing them to hash, fixes [#489](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/489) @craig-latacora

* 🐜 Ensure custom `print-method` supporting unreadable symbols preserves metadata

* 🐞 Preserve `*ns*` during `build!`, fixes [#506](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/506)

## 0.13.842 (2023-03-07)

* 💫 Support pagination for values nested inside `clerk/html`
* 🐞 Fix builder ui by using fully-qualifed symbol

## 0.13.838 (2023-03-02)

* 🌟 Make `build-graph` recur until all transitive deps are analyzed ([#381](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/381))

    Until now Clerk did not analyze the full transitive dependency graph which could lead to Clerk not detecting a change properly. Analysis is now recursive which means it's taking a bit longer initially. We cache analysis results per file in memory so subsequent analysis should be fast. We will follow up with visualizing the progress of analysis & execution.

    Also discovered cases where classes instead of symbols could end up in the dependency graph and introduced normalization to symbols.

    This also gets rid of the `->hash must be ifn?` warning which fixes [#375](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/375).

* 🔌 Offline suport: Serve viewer.js from storage.clerk.garden ([#415](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/415))

    Serve viewer.js from clerk CAS on storage.clerk.garden instead of google bucket.

    * Fixes [#377](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/377): adds support for serving the source map for Clerk's
      cljs bundle
    * Fixes [#387](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/387): avoids a http request on boot which would lead to a
failure when offline
    * Fixes [#408](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/408): Serve js from CDN


* 💫 Add `clerk/resolve-aliases` and make alias resolution explicit ([#410](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/410))

    This makes the alias resolution explicit via a new `clerk/resolve-aliases` function. The recommendation is now to use the full namespace in `:render-fn`s
or make the conversion explicit using `clerk/resolve-aliases`. **This is a breaking change.**

    We've also removed the automatic resolution from `->viewer-fn/eval` because it would depend on the evaluation context (a notebook that defines a viewer using aliases would render correctly but things could break if that viewer is being reused from another namespace that doesn't define the same aliases).

    These were the previously defined aliases which you must now change to these fully qualified symbols:
    ```clojure
    {'j 'applied-science.js-interop
     'reagent 'reagent.core
     'v 'nextjournal.clerk.viewer
     'p 'nextjournal.clerk.parser}
    ```

* 💫 Simplify modifying viewers ([#412](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/412))

    By exposing the two-arity version of `reset-viewers!` in the clerk
namespace. Also support symbols representing namespaces as the scope.

* ✍️ Support Sidenotes ([#392](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/392))

    Using the [pandoc footnotes extension](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#footnotes)

    Makes Clerk leverage the improved Sidenotes/Footnotes support from nextjournal/markdown[#11](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/11).

* 💫 Refactor viewer names to symbols matching vars ([#409](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/409))

    This changes the viewer names to be namespaced symbols matching the var names instead of plain keywords. This still allows to use them plainly without a dependency on Clerk using the metadata notation but enables jump to definition from your editor.

* 🌄 `image` and `caption` helpers ([#337](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/337))

    * `clerk/image` as convenience function to create a buffered image from a string or anything `javax.imageio.ImageIO/read` takes (URL, File, InputStream).
    * `clerk/caption` to render `text` as caption below any arbitrary `content`


* 🪡 Sticky Table Headers ([#305](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/305))

    * Keep table headers in view when scrolling
    * Keep elision buttons in view when scrolling
    * Add `vh-sticky-table-header` to deps.cljs

* 🛠 Simplify elision handling with continuation ([#421](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/421))

    Until now `present*` took a `:path` and `:current-path` argument
    would have a code path to descend into the nested data structure
    when resolving an elision. This drops this code path and uses a
    continuation function for a path instead.


* 🔪 Hide Clerk-specific metadata from code blocks ([#324](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/324))

    This removes the Clerk-specific metadata annotation like
    `^{:nextjournal.clerk/viewer ,,,}` from the code displayed in code
    cells in order to not distract from the essence. Metadata not
    coming from Clerk is left intact.

* 💫 Add dynamic `js/import` for JavaScript Modules ([#304](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/304))

    * Extend js global namespace with dynamic `js/import`
    * Add convenience react hook wrappers

    * 💫 Switch to [plotly.react](https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-function-reference/#plotlyreact) for better update performance
    * 💫 Expose end-line / end-column of code cells when parsing
    * 💫 Watch sync atoms and `recompute!` when they're changed ([#354](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/354))
    * 💫 Make clerk sync work with plain cljs using `add-watch`, fixes nextjournal/clerk-cljs-demo[#1](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/1)
    * 💫 Improve performance of `analyzer/exceeds-bounded-count-limit?`

    * 🛠 Throw when webserver can't be started


* 🛠 Drop viewers dependency, inlining used code ([#348](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/348))

    This drops the dependency on https://github.com/nextjournal/viewers and inlines the relevant code in Clerk.

* 🐜 Fix uberjar usage ([#358](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/358)), closes [#351](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/351).

    Fixes an error when Clerk is part of an uberjar because the `render.hashing` assumed it was being consumed as a git dep.

    When packaging Clerk as an uberjar, you need the following `build.clj` task as part of your build:

    ```clojure
    (defn package-clerk-asset-map [{:as opts :keys [target-dir]}]
      (when-not target-dir
        (throw (ex-info "target dir must be set" {:opts opts})))
      (let [asset-map @nextjournal.clerk.config/!asset-map]
        (spit (str target-dir java.io.File/separator "clerk-asset-map.edn") asset-map)))
    ```

* 💫 Deduplicate heading ids to improve linking ([#336](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/336))

    * Fixes [#330](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/330): Markdown headings don't have unique IDs
    * Fixes [#343](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/343): Does not scroll to relevant section when using anchor link

    Also extract emojis into separate attribute during markdown parsing.


* 🛠 Enable linting with clj-kondo in CI

* 🛠 Drop viewer-js-hash from repo, compute it at runtime ([#347](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/347))

    This drops the viewer-hash-js from the git repo, it was annoying
    as it always lead to conflicts. Instead we calculate the hash on
    startup in Clerk dev and when Clerk is used as a git dep. This
    step is skipped in the jar.

    When building a jar we now expect to see a `Skipping coordinate` warning.

    Also note that you might need to run `bb
    build+upload-viewer-resources` before the jar build.
    
* 🛠 Upgrade dependencies

    * Bump edamame dep
    * Bump sci to v0.6.37
    * Bump beholder dep, closes [#397](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/397)




## 0.12.707 (2022-12-06)

## 0.12.699 (2022-12-02)

* 🌟 Clerk sync for vars holding atoms ([#253](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/253), [#268](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/268))

    Introduce `^:nextjournal.clerk/sync` metadata annotation for vars
    holding atoms to enable automatically syncing state between JVM
    Clojure and the SCI environment running in the browser: the var
    will be interned by Clerk in the sci environment and calls to
    `swap!` or `reset!` will be syncronized to the JVM. Use editscript
    for sending a minimal patch to the browser to enable 60fps
    updates.
    
* 🌟 Improvements to Clerk's SCI Environment running in the Browser

    * Simplify writing of viewer `:render-fn`s by dropping need
      `v/html` is no longer needed in render functions of custom
      viewers, vector values will be handled as reagent components.
    * Introduce `nextjournal.clerk.render` namespace to hold all
     `:render-fn`s and reference them using fully qualifed names from
     `nextjournal.clerk.viewer` to make it obvious where they are
     coming from. Also refactor `nextjournal.clerk.sci-viewer` to
     `nextjournal.clerk.sci-env`.
    * Support alias resolution for `:render-fn`s ([#276](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/276))
    * Upgrade to React 18.2 and introduce
      `nextjournal.clerk.render.hooks` as a thin cljs wrapper around
      [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) also
      useable from the sci env. ([#237](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/237), [#242](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/242))
    * Introduce `nextjournal.clerk.render.code` ns with support for
      read-only and editable code cells ([#285](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/285))
    * Improve error handling with `ErrorBoundary` rewrite using
      `shadow.cljs.modern/defclass` ([#255](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/255))
    * Fix page jump between updates for Vega and Plotly viewer and
      improve error display. This is implemented using React
      Hooks. ([#231](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/231))
    * Support callback for vega viewer to access the vega-embed object
      ([#279](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/279))
    * Move sci env `deps.edn` to separate deps root ([#278](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/278)). This allows
      folks to take over the cljs build of clerk in order to support
      additional namespaces.

* 💫 Show shape of data using auto-expansion of results (opt-in for now) ([#258](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/258))

    This allows letting Clerk auto expand data results via the
    `:nextjournal.clerk/auto-expand-results? true` setting in the
    `ns` metadata. You can use the same key in `::clerk/opts` on single result
    too.
  
* 💫 Improvement to static `nextjournal.clerk/build!`

    * Allow to set Open Graph Metadata for notebooks using
      `:nextjournal.clerk/open-graph` map in ns metadata with `:url`,
      `:title`, `:description` and `:image` keys ([#243](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/243))
    * Support `:ssr` setting for server-side rendering in static builds ([#254](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/254), [#275](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/275))
    * Support `:compile-css` attribute to compile step with Tailwind ([#246](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/246))

* 🌟 Support Viewer CSS class customizations ([#294](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/294))

    This supports providing custom classes to viewers and the notebook
    viewer which should allow for most use cases and does not require
    actually overriding the base styles. Once a
    `:nextjournal.clerk/css-class` is available on the viewer or in
    document settings, the available class will be used and no further
    viewer classes will be assigned.

* 💫 Let viewer opt out of var-from-def unwrapping

    This fixes an inconsistency in the viewer api: until now we'd unwrap
    a `:nextjournal.clerk/var-from-def` when a viewer is applied using an
    `fn?` like `clerk/table` but not when given a viewer map.
    
    We now always unwrap the var unless the viewer opts out with a truthy
    `:var-from-def?` key.

* 🐞 Revert "Inline vega lite viewer and make it show errors" as it
  caused a regression that a vega visualization would only update
  after a refresh.

## 0.10.560 (2022-09-14)

* 💫 Improve errors on eval by keeping location information on form
* 🐜 Don't throw when valuehash cannot be computed for deref dep
* 🐞 Inline vega lite viewer and make it show errors
* 🐞 Fix multi-expand via Option+Click
* 🛠 Allow to run ui tests against local build

## 0.10.550 (2022-09-06)

* 🌟 Support setting visibility for results 🙈

    Specifying code cell & result visibility is now easier & more
    powerful. Previously setting result visibility only possible
    per-form using a `hide-result` viewer. You can now pass a map with
    `:code` and `:result` keys to control code & result visibility
    individually.

    To set this per-document, put the visibility on the ns form like
    for example:

      (ns my-namespace
        "This namespace will have code cells folded and results hidden"
        {:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :fold :result :hide}})

    You can still override this per-form using metadata, so the
    following form will be shown.
    
      ^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :show}}
      (inc 41)
    
    or change the defaults midway through the doc using a _visibility
    marker_:
    
      {:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :show}}
            
    Also support `:nextjournal.clerk/toc` setting on ns metadata.
    
* ⭐️ Fail eval if var is only present at runtime but not in file 🕵🏻
    
    This makes Clerk be more strict than the REPL and actually complain
    when one still depends on a var no longer present in the file.
    
    The check is currently only performed for the notebook being shown iff
    it starts with an `ns` form.
    
    
* 💫 Rename viewer attribute `[:fetch-opts :n]` to `:page-size`
* 💫 More subtle indication for folded code cells

* 💫 Cut down of depedencies of `nextjournal.clerk.sci-viewer` in
  order to simplify consumption as a library and slim down bundle by
  290kb (73kb gzip)

* 💫 Unbundle images when `:bundle?` is `false` ([#208](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/208))

    As a quick fix to make the Clerk Book viewable we're now writing
    images for the static build to files when `:bundle?` is set to
    false. In a follow-up we'll support absolute urls for the images
    and introduce a separate flag for this.

* 🐜 Don't attempt to check bounded count limit for non-freezable
  things, fixes [#199](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/199) ([#201](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/201))
* 🐜 Fix regression in showing sorted-map results
* 🐜 Fix table viewer normalization error when given sorted map
* 🐞 Use PngEncoder lib for 10x improvement in encoding performance ([#197](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/197))
* 🐞 Overflow per single result not by result container ([#198](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/198))
    
    When result contains multiple tables, allow scrolling each table
    individually instead of the entire result container. Also works
    with plots.

* 🐞 Equalizes vertical spacing between Markdown, code and results
* 🐞 Fixes the quoted string viewer layout when expanded

## 0.9.513 (2022-07-18)

* 🌟 Valuehash ⚛️

    Treat `clojure.core/deref` expressions separately in the dependency graph
    and attempt to compute a hash at runtime based on the value of the
    expression. This lets Clerk see an updated value for these expressions
    without needing to opt out of Clerk's caching using `^:nextjournal.clerk/no-cache` ([#187](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/187)).

* ⭐️ Expand indicators & allow option-click to expand all siblings

    This adds an affordance to make it obvious that collections can be expanded. In
    addition, we support Option-Click to expand all sibling nodes on a level.

* ⭐️ Add `nextjournal.clerk/eval-cljs-str` that can be used to provide
  viewer `:render-fn`s from other sources. Defining them in a separate
  .cljs file makes linting work on them.

* 💫 Add docstrings for Clerk's public API in `nextjournal.clerk`.

* 🐞 Improve error handling in `:render-fn`s, showing better errors for
  different failure modes:
  
  * undefined symbol on read
  * runtime exception
  * calling `inspect` without a valid presented value
  * passing an invalid hiccup form to `v/html`

* 🐞 Fix Clerk's dependency analysis to detect in macros
* 🛠 Bump deps of `io.github.nextjournal/clojure-mode` and `io.github.nextjournal/markdown`
* 🛠 Refactor `builder`, `parser` `eval`, to its own namespaces, rename `hashing` to `analysis`.
* 🛠 Remove keyword indirection from viewer API
* 🛠 Lean more heavily on `tools.analyzer` for depedency analysis

## 0.8.470 (2022-06-20)
* 🐞 Markdown library now uses a GraalJS version compatible with Java 8. Fixes [#178](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/178)
* 🐞 Bundle asset map during Maven release to allow clerk to function behind a proxy. Fixes [#147](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/147)
* 🛠 Preserve asset name in content-addressed asset URL ([#181](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/181))

## 0.8.463 (2022-06-16)
* 💫 Support `:nextjournal.clerk/no-cache` meta on form also for vars.

    Previously it would have to go on a different place for vars than
    for unnamed top-level expressions.

    Setting it on the var will be deprecated and so consistently
    setting it on the form is recommend from now on.

* 💫 Support rich values (with viewers) in table headers
* 🐜 Preserve `*ns*` during analysis and eval ([#173](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/173))
* 🐜 Upgrade markdown library with
    * support for loose lists

## 0.8.451 (2022-06-09)
* ⭐ Move default viewers to vars to make inspecting & building on them easier ([#167](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/167))
* 💫 Introduce flexible grid layout viewers `row` and `col` ([#162](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/162))
* 🐜 Introduce checks for forms which cannot be cached to disk ([#166](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/166))
* 🐞 Display inline comments in code cell rather than in prose, fixes [#71](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/71).

## 0.8.445 (2022-06-01)
* 💫 First cut of Clerk Examples

    Add the `nextjournal.clerk/example` macro that evaluates to `nil`,
    just like `clojure.core/comment` when used outside of Clerk. When
    used in the context of Clerk it renders the expressions with their
    resulting values.
    
* 🐞 Fix reported duration for static bundle build step

## 0.8.442 (2022-06-01)
* 🌟 Simplify viewer api by letting `:transform-fn` act on wrapped-value ([#152](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/152))
    
    This simplifies the viewer api by letting `:transform-fn` act on
    the wrapped-value. This way the `:transform-fn` can now serve as the
    single JVM-extension point and also serve as `:fetch-fn` (using
    `mark-presented`) and `:update-viewers-fn`.
    
    In the case of a `:fetch-fn` the transformation would previously
    happen in a second pass. Now it is always eager, which should make it
    much clearer what's happening.
    
    Also do a naming pass:
    
    * `describe` → `present`
    * `merge-descriptions` → `merge-presentations`
    
    
* ⭐️ Extend the reach of the viewer api to the root node.

    This allows full customization of how a Clerk doc is displayed. Showcase
    that by implementing a slideshow viewer.
  
* ⭐️ Show render-fn errors and simplify and improve default viewers

    Show a somewhat useful error when a viewer's `:render-fn` errors, either on eval or when invoked as a render function later. Since the stack property of `js/Error` isn't standardized the usefulness differs between browsers and variants. The advanced compiled js bundle is currently lacking source maps so the stack isn't useful there, yet.

    Also simplify and improve the default viewers by having a fallback reader function for unknown tags and display anything that's readable with it using the pagination inside the browser. We can use this as a generic fallback and drop a number of specialised viewers (`uuid?`, `fn?`, `inst?`). It also means Clerk will now display these fallback objects identical to how Clojure will print them. Note that this also means that bringing in library like cider.nrepl that extends `print-method` will affect how things are displayed in Clerk.

    Lastly, we include a viewer for `clojure.lang.IDeref` that will use Clerk's JVM-side pagination behaviour for the `:val`.

    More rationale and live examples in the [Better Printing ADR](https://snapshots.nextjournal.com/clerk/build/7f510cde367ee9de6765c3f3dd7013e8bf19c64b/index.html#/notebooks/viewers/printing.clj) notebook.

* 💫 Refactor analysis to support multiple defs per top-level form ([#159](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/159))
* 🐜 Make no-cache on side-effecting var invalidate dependents ([#158](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/158)), fixes [#157](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/157)
* 🐞 Fix lazy loading when viewer is selected via metadata.
* 🐞 Perform bounded count limit check on tree ([#154](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/154))

    Previously this would only be performed on the root node so we'd go out of
    memory attempting to cache a value like `{:a (range)}`.
    
* 🛠 Update SCI & SCI configs ([#151](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/151))
* 🛠 Start Clerk on `bb dev` after first cljs compile and forward serve opts.

* 🐜 Opt out of caching deref forms
* 🐜 Protect cache from caching nil from repeated defonce eval
* 💫 Upgrade to SCI v0.3.1

## 0.5.346 (2022-01-27)
This release focuses on improving the viewer api:

* 🌟 new built-in image viewer component  for `java.awt.image.BufferedImage` with automatic layouting. These can be easily created constructed from `javax.imageio.ImageIO/read` from `File`, `URL` or `InputStream`.
* 🌟 Enable nested viewers inside e.g. `html` or `table` viewers.
* 🌟 Allow to convey viewers out-of-band using metadata. Clerk's viewer api has been based on functions. This can be undesired if you want to depend on the unmodified value downstream. You can now alternatively use metadata using the `:nextjournal.clerk/viewer` to convey the viewer. Valid values are viewer functions or keywords. The latter is useful when you don't want a runtime dependency on Clerk. ([#58](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/58))
* 💫 `:render-fn` must now be quoted to make it clearer it doesn't run on the JVM but in the browser ([#53](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/53))
* 💫 Make all viewer functions take an optional map to specify the with using the `:nextjournal.clerk/width` with valid values `:full`, `:wide` or `:prose`. ([#53](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/53))
* 💫 Enable access to vars resulting from eval in viewers @philomates ([#47](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/47))
* 💫 Expose title, table of contents as the result of parse. Set title in browser. @zampino ([#56](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/56))
* 💫 Add halt! to allow stopping Clerk @SneakyPeet ([#43](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/43))*
* 💫 Upgrade to tailwindcss 3 and use via play cdn. This enables using any tailwind properties. ([#36](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/36))
* 💫 Allow to bring your own css and js ([#55](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/55))
* 🐜 Introduce print budget to elide deeply nested structures. This should fix overflowing the browser with too much data for certain shapes of data ([#48](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/48))
* 🐞 Recover from a viewer rendering error without requiring a browser reload and improve error display.
* 🛠 Refactor & tests various parts

## 0.4.316 (2021-12-21)
* 💫 Add option to control opening of built static app (@filipesilva, [#31](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/31))
* 🐜 Fix path error on windows by bumping markdown dep ([#34](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/34))
* 🐞 Fix browse in `build-static-app!` on windows ([#39](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/39))

## 0.4.305 (2021-12-13)
* 🌟 Support markdown as an alternative to Clojure source code for prose-heavy documents.
* 🌟 Changed viewer api: Added a `:transform-fn` that allows a transformation of a value in JVM Clojure. Also rename `:fn` to `:render-fn` for clarify and ensure the `:pred` only runs on JVM Clojure to enable using predicates that cannot run in sci in the browser. Add support for serving arbitrary blobs  via a `:fetch-fn` that returns a map with `:nextjournal/content-type` and `nextjournal/value` keys ([example](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/blob/8ad88630f746f1a9ff3ac314f5528c2d25c42583/notebooks/viewers/image.clj)).
* 🌟 Added `v/clerk-eval` to the viewer api which takes a quoted form and evaluates it in the context of the document namespace.
* ⭐️ Allow setting code cell & result visibility via
  `:nextjournal.clerk/visibility` metadata on a form. Valid values are: `:show` (default) `:fold` or `:hide`. These settings can be set on individual forms, setting them on the `ns` form changes the default for all forms in the document. If you want to affect only the `ns` form, use  `:fold-ns` or `:hide-ns` ([example](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/blob/8ad88630f746f1a9ff3ac314f5528c2d25c42583/notebooks/visibility.clj)).
* 💫 Added a dynamic binding `config/*in-clerk*` that is only true when Clerk is driving evaluation.
* 💫 Persist viewer expansion state across document reloads and make document updates minimize repaints and flickering.
* 💫 Keep document scroll position when an error is shown by moving error into overlay.
* 💫 Wrap sci context in an atom to let consumers change it.
* 💫 Exclude Emacs lock files from being shown via file watcher [#22](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/22) (@ikappaki)
* 💫 Add viewers for Clojure vars and a catch all `pr-str` viewer
* 🐜 Don't cache uncountable values within `*bounded-count-limit*` [#15](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/issues/15).
* 🐞 Prevent infinite loop when calling `show!` in a notebook using `config/*in-clerk*`.
